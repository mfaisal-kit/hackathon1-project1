# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module introduces ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system that connects AI decision-making to physical humanoid robot control.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Explain ROS 2 architecture and middleware concepts
- Build and reason about ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Bridge Python-based AI agents to robot controllers using rclpy
- Understand and read URDF files for humanoid robots
- Conceptually trace data flow from AI logic → ROS 2 → humanoid movement

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: ROS 2 as the Robotic Nervous System** - Conceptual overview of Physical AI and embodied intelligence, ROS 2 architecture and middleware role, nodes, topics, services, and message flow.

2. **Chapter 2: Communicating with Robots Using ROS 2** - ROS 2 nodes lifecycle, topics vs services vs actions, Python agents interacting with robots via rclpy, mapping AI decisions to actuator commands.

3. **Chapter 3: Humanoid Robot Structure with URDF** - Purpose of URDF in humanoid robotics, links, joints, and kinematic chains, how URDF connects software control to physical bodies.

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system.
