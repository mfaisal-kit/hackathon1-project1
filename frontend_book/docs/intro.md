# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This comprehensive course covers the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robot control, connecting AI decision-making to physical humanoid robot control.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four main modules that progressively build your understanding of how AI systems can control physical robots:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI to robots
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Python agents interacting with robots via rclpy

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Physics simulation with Gazebo
- High-fidelity interaction with Unity
- Simulated sensors for perception

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for synthetic data
- Isaac ROS for perception and localization
- Nav2 for navigation systems

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Voice-to-action with speech models
- Language-driven cognitive planning
- The autonomous humanoid capstone

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system.
