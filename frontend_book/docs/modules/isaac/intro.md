# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive robotics platform for building the robot's AI brain. You will learn to implement perception, localization, and autonomous navigation systems for humanoid robots using Isaac's advanced tools and frameworks, including Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation, Isaac ROS for perception pipelines, and Nav2 for navigation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Implement hardware-accelerated visual SLAM and sensor processing using Isaac ROS
- Configure and optimize Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation and path planning
- Generate synthetic datasets for training perception models in Isaac Sim
- Integrate perception, localization, and navigation systems into a cohesive AI brain
- Deploy and evaluate AI systems on simulated humanoid robots

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data** - Understanding Isaac Sim architecture, setting up photorealistic simulation environments, configuring lighting and physics for realistic rendering, creating synthetic datasets for perception model training, and applying domain randomization techniques.

2. **Chapter 2: Isaac ROS for Perception & Localization** - Understanding the Isaac ROS framework, setting up hardware-accelerated perception pipelines, implementing visual SLAM algorithms, applying sensor fusion techniques for improved localization, and processing point clouds and 3D perception data.

3. **Chapter 3: Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation** - Understanding Nav2 architecture for humanoid robots, configuring the navigation stack for bipedal locomotion, implementing path planning algorithms for humanoid movement, and developing obstacle avoidance and dynamic re-planning strategies.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System)
- Completed Module 2 (The Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity)
- Basic understanding of perception and navigation concepts
- Familiarity with AI/ML concepts
- Access to an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for Isaac tools

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the fundamentals of NVIDIA Isaac Sim and how it enables the generation of synthetic data for training perception models, which forms the foundation of the AI brain for humanoid robots.
