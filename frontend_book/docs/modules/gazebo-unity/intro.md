# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on creating high-fidelity digital twins of humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity to simulate physics, environments, and sensor data before real-world deployment.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure physics simulations in Gazebo for humanoid robots
- Model realistic physics behaviors including gravity, collisions, and joint dynamics
- Create high-fidelity visual environments in Unity for human-robot interaction
- Configure simulated sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) for AI perception pipelines
- Understand the alignment between simulation and real-world robot behavior
- Implement simulation-to-real transfer techniques for robot control

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Understanding Gazebo's physics engine, setting up gravity models, configuring collision detection, modeling joint dynamics, and creating realistic environments for robot testing.

2. **Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Interaction with Unity** - Setting up Unity for robotics simulation workflows, creating visually realistic environments for human-robot interaction, implementing physics simulation using Unity's engine, and aligning simulation behavior with real-world robot performance.

3. **Chapter 3: Simulated Sensors for Perception** - Understanding different sensor types in simulation, configuring LiDAR sensors in Gazebo and Unity, setting up depth cameras for 3D perception, implementing IMU simulation, and integrating simulated sensor data with AI perception pipelines.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System)
- Basic understanding of humanoid robot kinematics
- Familiarity with physics concepts (gravity, collisions, dynamics)
- Basic understanding of sensor types and functions

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the fundamentals of physics simulation in Gazebo, which forms the foundation for creating digital twins of humanoid robots.
