# AI-Robot Brain Module Task Breakdown Creation History

## Original Prompt
```
sp.tasks
```

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive task breakdown at `specs/isaac-module/tasks.md` with:
- Three main categories: Environment/Setup, Content Creation, and Integration/Testing
- Specific, testable tasks with clear acceptance criteria and validation steps
- Proper alignment with the three-chapter structure
- Detailed procedures for each task with checklists
- Testing procedures to validate completion of each task
- Emphasis on AI brain concepts and preparation for advanced applications

## Key Changes Made
1. Organized tasks into three main categories
2. Created specific tasks for each phase of implementation
3. Defined clear acceptance criteria with checkboxes
4. Added testing procedures for each task
5. Ensured alignment with three-chapter structure
6. Included validation steps for quality assurance
7. Integrated AI brain concepts throughout task definitions

## Validation
- All tasks have clear objectives
- Acceptance criteria are measurable
- Testing procedures are defined
- Chapter structure properly represented
- Dependencies between tasks identified
- AI brain concepts consistently applied
