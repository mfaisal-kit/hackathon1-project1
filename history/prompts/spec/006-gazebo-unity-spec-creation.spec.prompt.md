# Digital Twin Module Specification Creation History

## Original Prompt
```
sp.specify Module:
Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Course:
Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Target Audience

AI and robotics students learning simulation and digital twin concepts.

Module Focus

Create high-fidelity digital twins of humanoid robots to simulate physics, environments, and sensor data before real-world deployment.

Chapters (Docusaurus Pages)

Physics Simulation with Gazebo
Gravity, collisions, joint dynamics, and environment setup for humanoid robots.

High-Fidelity Interaction with Unity
Visual realism, human-robot interaction, and simulation-to-real alignment.

Simulated Sensors for Perception
LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs as inputs for AI perception pipelines.
```

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive specification document at `specs/gazebo-unity-module/spec.md` with:
- Detailed module overview and target audience
- Clear learning objectives aligned with requirements
- Comprehensive scope sections (in/out of scope)
- Three detailed chapters with specific content requirements:
  * Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
  * Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Interaction with Unity
  * Chapter 3: Simulated Sensors for Perception
- Technical and content requirements
- Acceptance criteria for each chapter
- Constraints, dependencies, and success metrics
- Risk assessment

## Key Changes Made
1. Created structured specification with proper headings
2. Defined all learning outcomes as specified
3. Included detailed chapter content requirements
4. Added acceptance criteria for each deliverable
5. Documented constraints and limitations
6. Included success metrics and risk assessment
7. Emphasized digital twin concepts throughout

## Validation
- All required chapters included
- Learning outcomes properly defined
- Constraints properly documented
- Format follows Docusaurus compatibility
- Tone appropriate for target audience
- Digital twin concepts consistently applied
