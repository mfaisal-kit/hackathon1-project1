# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module Specification History

**Date:** 2025-01-04
**Module:** Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Activity:** Specification Creation
**Status:** Completed

## Specification Details

### Learning Objectives Defined
- Integrate speech-to-text systems with robot command processing for voice-to-action conversion
- Use large language models (LLMs) to translate natural language goals into sequences of ROS 2 actions
- Implement end-to-end systems that combine perception, navigation, object recognition, and manipulation
- Design cognitive planning pipelines that bridge high-level language commands with low-level robot actions
- Evaluate the performance and reliability of VLA systems in real-world scenarios
- Address challenges in multimodal integration and real-time processing

### Chapter Structure
1. Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action with Speech Models
2. Chapter 2: Language-Driven Cognitive Planning  
3. Chapter 3: Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid (with history tracking)

### Technical Requirements
- Markdown format compatible with Docusaurus
- Clear headings and subheadings (H1, H2, H3, H4)
- Consistent terminology across chapters
- Diagrams described textually where helpful
- AI-native, spec-driven framing throughout

### History Tracking Requirements Added
- History tracking and context management for continuous learning
- Interaction logging for speech recognition events
- Context preservation across conversation turns
- Historical data analysis for system improvement
- Privacy considerations in history management

### Acceptance Criteria
- Reader can integrate speech-to-text with robot systems
- Reader can use LLMs for cognitive planning with historical context
- Reader can implement complete VLA systems with history tracking
- Content serves as foundation for advanced applications
- Follows all specified constraints and style guidelines
