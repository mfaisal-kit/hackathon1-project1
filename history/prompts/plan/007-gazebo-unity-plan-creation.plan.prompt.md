# Digital Twin Module Implementation Plan Creation History

## Original Prompt
```
sp.plan Set up the Docusaurus site structure and create Module 2 with three chapter pages covering Gazebo physics, Unity-based interaction, and sensor simulation.
Write each chapter as a separate .md file, explaining digital twin concepts and preparing learners for advanced perception and training modules.
```

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive implementation plan at `specs/gazebo-unity-module/plan.md` with:
- Detailed architectural decisions for Docusaurus integration and content organization
- Step-by-step implementation phases covering environment setup, content creation, and enhancement
- Specific procedures for creating the three required chapters
- Dependencies, error handling, and validation steps
- Success criteria for both functional and content requirements
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Deployment considerations and next steps

## Key Changes Made
1. Defined architecture decisions with rationale and trade-offs
2. Created detailed implementation phases with specific steps
3. Outlined content creation process for all three chapters
4. Added validation and testing procedures
5. Included success criteria and risk mitigation
6. Provided deployment guidance
7. Emphasized digital twin concepts and preparation for advanced modules

## Validation
- All implementation phases covered
- Architecture decisions properly justified
- Content creation steps detailed
- Dependencies and risks addressed
- Success criteria measurable
- Digital twin concepts integrated throughout plan
