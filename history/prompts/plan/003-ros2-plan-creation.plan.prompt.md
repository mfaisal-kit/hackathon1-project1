# ROS 2 Module Implementation Plan Creation History

## Original Prompt
```
sp.plan First, install and initialize Docusaurus, set up the documentation site, and create the folder structure for Module 1 with three chapter pages.
Then, add each module and chapter as separate Markdown (.md) files, ensuring all content is written and organized in Docusaurus-compatible format.
```

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive implementation plan at `specs/ros2-module/plan.md` with:
- Detailed architectural decisions for Docusaurus version, project structure, and theming
- Step-by-step implementation phases covering environment setup, project structure, content creation, and enhancement
- Specific procedures for creating the three required chapters
- Dependencies, error handling, and validation steps
- Success criteria for both functional and content requirements
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Deployment considerations and next steps

## Key Changes Made
1. Defined architecture decisions with rationale and trade-offs
2. Created detailed implementation phases with specific steps
3. Outlined content creation process for all three chapters
4. Added validation and testing procedures
5. Included success criteria and risk mitigation
6. Provided deployment guidance

## Validation
- All implementation phases covered
- Architecture decisions properly justified
- Content creation steps detailed
- Dependencies and risks addressed
- Success criteria measurable
