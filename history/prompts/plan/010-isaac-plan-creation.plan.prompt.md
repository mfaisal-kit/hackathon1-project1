# AI-Robot Brain Module Implementation Plan Creation History

## Original Prompt
```
sp.plan Create the Module 3 section in Docusaurus and add three chapter pages explaining NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 as the robot's AI brain.
Write each chapter as a separate Markdown (.md) file, focusing on perception, localization, and navigation concepts.
```

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive implementation plan at `specs/isaac-module/plan.md` with:
- Detailed architectural decisions for Docusaurus integration and content organization
- Step-by-step implementation phases covering environment setup, content creation, and enhancement
- Specific procedures for creating the three required chapters
- Dependencies, error handling, and validation steps
- Success criteria for both functional and content requirements
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Deployment considerations and next steps

## Key Changes Made
1. Defined architecture decisions with rationale and trade-offs
2. Created detailed implementation phases with specific steps
3. Outlined content creation process for all three chapters
4. Added validation and testing procedures
5. Included success criteria and risk mitigation
6. Provided deployment guidance
7. Emphasized AI brain concepts and preparation for advanced applications

## Validation
- All implementation phases covered
- Architecture decisions properly justified
- Content creation steps detailed
- Dependencies and risks addressed
- Success criteria measurable
- AI brain concepts integrated throughout plan
